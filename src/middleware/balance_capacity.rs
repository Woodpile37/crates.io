//! Reject certain requests as instance load reaches capacity.
//!
//! The primary goal of this middleware is to avoid starving the download endpoint of resources.
//! When bots send many parallel requests that run slow database queries, download requests may
//! block and eventually timeout waiting for a database connection.
//!
//! Bots must continue to respect our crawler policy, but until we can manually block bad clients
//! we should avoid dropping download requests even if that means rejecting some legitimate
//! requests to other endpoints.
